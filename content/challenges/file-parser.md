## Introduction

A fresh php developer was given the task to write a file parser to parse the content of any given file and return its content as a php array.

For a first step, he was asked to parse only json and xml files.

This repo represents (https://github.com/moroccan-phpers/challenge-1-file-parser) his implementation. A Senior developer in the same company reviewed it and did not like it.

## Task

Your task is to evaluate this implementation and implement it in your way.

- What are your thoughts about? What are the good things? the bad ones?
